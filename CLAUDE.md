- Let shadcn/ui and theme handle default spacing, sizing, and colors - only add classes when deviating from defaults
- Avoid redundant classes: `border-border`, `text-foreground`, `variant="default"`, fixed widths, unnecessary flex/gap/margin/pad
- when working with cloud functions, always read online about cloud functions v2 implementation since it is very new.
- When working with shadcn components, always make sure to look up reference in shadcn, for example - https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/context-menu
- don't add code comments
- when testing changes, run build unless explicitly asked to run a dev server
- icons that are within size="icon" buttons, do not need size classnames.
