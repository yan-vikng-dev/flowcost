# Flowcost - Expense Tracker for Digital Nomads

Multi-currency expense tracking with real-time collaboration.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Functions, AI)
- **AI**: Firebase AI (GoogleAIBackend) with Gemini 2.5 Flash for structured entry parsing
- **State**: React hooks, real-time Firestore listeners

## Architecture

### Data Model
- **Users**: Profile with `displayCurrency` and `connectedUserIds[]` (mutual connections)
- **Entries**: Expenses/income tied to users
- **Invitations**: Pending connection invitations
- **RecurringTemplates**: Schedules that materialize future `entries` (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)

### Key Features
1. **Multi-currency**: Store in original currency, convert on display
2. **Real-time sync**: Connected users and entries update live
3. **Connections**: Users share expenses with mutually connected users
4. **Simple invitations**: Email-based with accept/reject via Cloud Functions
5. **Recurring entries**: Create schedules that auto-generate future entries; edit a single instance or the whole series
6. **AI entry generation**: Natural language and multimodal entry creation via Firebase AI

## Development Guidelines

**NOTE: Pre-production - No backups or migrations needed. Prioritize development speed.**

### Firestore
- Use `convertFirestoreDoc()` for all document fetches (handles ID + timestamps)
- Dates stored at UTC midnight for timezone consistency
- Security rules enforce mutual-connection-based access
- Real-time listeners for entries and connected users

### Date/Timezone Handling
- **UTC for keys and comparisons**: Use UTC methods (`getUTCFullYear()`, `getUTCMonth()`, `getUTCDay()`) for date keys and comparisons
- Month keys for exchange rates: use `getUTCFullYear()` and `getUTCMonth()`
- Day-of-week calculations for recurring entries: use `getUTCDay()`
- Recurrence stepping uses date-fns; monthly stepping uses local `setDate()` with final storage via `toUTCMidnight()`
- Date range calculations: use UTC methods to avoid timezone boundary issues

### UI Patterns
- DataState component for loading/empty/error states  
- Three-dot menu on entries for edit/delete
- Minimal header icons for actions
- Compact horizontal layouts for empty states
- Let shadcn handle default spacing/styling
  - Recurrence setup lives within `entry-form.tsx` (inline); series overview in `recurring-view.tsx`

### Currency Handling
- `originalAmount`: Stored with currency code
- **Fixed historical rates**: Uses exchange rates from entry date (not current rates)
- **Monthly rate storage**: Rates grouped by month in Firestore (`exchangeRates/YYYY-MM`)
- **Current implementation**: ExchangeRate-API v6 via scheduled Cloud Function; local dev seeding script included; full currency set supported (UI highlights popular subset)
- Display in user's `displayCurrency`
- formatCurrency() handles display with proper signs
- Weekend entries use Friday's rates (forex markets closed)
  - Recurring instances use the rate for their scheduled date

### Daily Budget
- BudgetView component shows remaining daily allowance
- Formula: (monthly income including today - monthly expenses excluding today) / remaining days

### Recurring Entries
- Stored as templates in Firestore collection `recurringTemplates` with:
  - `entryTemplate` (type, originalAmount, currency, category, description)
  - `recurrence` (frequency: `daily|weekly|monthly|yearly`, `interval`, `endDate`, optional `daysOfWeek`, optional `dayOfMonth` for monthly)
  - `startDate`, `createdBy`, `createdAt`
- Materialization behavior:
  - On create, all occurrences between `startDate` and `endDate` are generated as normal `entries` with fields:
    - `recurringTemplateId`, `isRecurringInstance = true`, `isModified = false`
  - Entry IDs use stable format `rt_{templateId}_{yyyyMMdd}`
  - Dates are clamped to `SERVICE_START_DATE` and stored via `toUTCMidnight()`
- **Template editing removed**: Users delete/stop and recreate instead.
- Stopping a series:
  - Deletes all future instances from a given date forward (default: today inclusive)
  - Keeps template for history
  - Designed for reactive use case: user sees unwanted recurring entry and stops it
- Deleting a series:
  - Deletes the template and all instances (modified and unmodified)
- Limits:
  - Practical horizons per frequency (see `RECURRENCE_LIMITS`): daily/weekly up to 1 year, monthly/yearly up to 5 years

### AI Entry Generation
- **Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash via Firebase AI with structured output
- **Schema validation**: Uses Firebase AI Schema for consistent JSON responses  
- **Input types**: Natural language text, images (receipts), audio recordings, PDFs
- **Multimodal support**: File processing via base64 encoding to GenerativePart
- **Auto-creation**: Entries with confidence ≥ 0.3 are automatically created
- **Smart parsing**: Extracts type, amount, currency, category, date, description with confidence score
- **UI integration**: `LLMEntryInput` at dashboard bottom with text and file upload controls
- **Category matching**: Maps to existing CATEGORY_NAMES enum for consistency
- **Date handling**: Defaults to today, parses transaction dates when available
- **Toast feedback**: Success notifications with date display and navigation to daily view

## AI Context Addendum

- Security rules summary:
  - All access requires auth. Access permitted if users are mutually connected.
  - `users`: read/write own; read others only if mutually connected.
  - `entries`: read/write if `userId == uid` or mutually connected to `userId` (date must be ≥ `SERVICE_START_DATE`).
  - `recurringTemplates`: same as entries (by owner userId); start/end dates must be ≥ `SERVICE_START_DATE`.
  - `connectionInvitations`: sender/recipient access; CF handles acceptance.
  - `exchangeRates`: read for authenticated clients; writes via Functions only.
  - `waitlist`: unauthenticated `create` only (strict field validation); no read/update/delete.
  - `budgetAllocations`: owner and mutual connections can read/list/update/delete; create allowed for owner or connections.

- Firestore schema (cheat sheet):
  - `users/{uid}`: `id, email, name, displayName?, photoUrl?, displayCurrency, connectedUserIds[], createdAt`
  - `connectionInvitations/{id}`: `invitedEmail, invitedBy, inviterName, createdAt, expiresAt`
  - `entries/{entryId}`: `id, userId, type, originalAmount, currency, category, description?, date, createdBy, createdAt, updatedAt?, updatedBy?, location?, recurringTemplateId?, isRecurringInstance?, isModified?`
  - `recurringTemplates/{id}`: `userId, entryTemplate{type, originalAmount, currency, category, description?}, recurrence{frequency, interval, endDate, daysOfWeek?, dayOfMonth?}, startDate, createdBy, createdAt`
  - `exchangeRates/YYYY-MM`: `{ [yyyy-mm-dd]: { [CURRENCY]: rate } }`
  - `waitlist/{emailId}`: `email, createdAt, source`

- Indexes used:
  - `entries(userId ASC, date DESC)`
  - `entries(userId ASC, recurringTemplateId ASC, date ASC)`
  - `entries(userId ASC, recurringTemplateId ASC, isModified ASC, date ASC)`
  - `recurringTemplates(userId ASC, createdAt DESC)`

- Query limits & patterns:
  - Firestore `in` operator limit: 10 values. Services chunk member lists when needed.
  - Common pattern: equality on `userId` + range on `date` + `orderBy('date')`.

- Local dev setup:
  - Emulators (development only): Auth `9099`, Firestore `8080`, Functions `5001`, Emulator UI `4000`.
  - Functions region: `asia-southeast1`.
  - Required env (NEXT_PUBLIC_*): `FIREBASE_API_KEY, FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN, FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID, FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET, FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID, FIREBASE_APP_ID, MEASUREMENT_ID`.
  - Deploy rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project <project>`.

- Exchange rates flow:
  - Local development: Use `pnpm seed` to populate exchange rates from SERVICE_START_DATE to today.
  - Production: Daily rates fetched via scheduled Cloud Function from ExchangeRate-API v6 and stored under `exchangeRates/YYYY-MM`.
  - Cache policy: historical months indefinite; current month until next UTC midnight; future months 1h.
  - Conversion uses exact date or nearest available (weekends/missing).

- Recurring specifics:
  - Entry ID format: `rt_{templateId}_{yyyyMMdd}`; instances store `isRecurringInstance`, `isModified`.
  - Template editing removed for simplicity - users delete/stop and recreate instead.
  - Stop series: delete future instances from provided date (default today inclusive); preserves template for history.
  - Delete series: remove template and all instances (modified and unmodified).

- AI entry parsing:
  - Schema-based: `entrySchema` defines structured output format (type, amount, currency, category, description, date, confidence).
  - Multimodal: Processes text, images, audio, and PDFs via `fileToGenerativePart()` base64 conversion.
  - Confidence threshold: Auto-creates entries with confidence ≥ 0.3; rejects lower confidence results.
  - Component integration: `LLMEntryInput` at dashboard bottom with text + file upload controls.

- Entries cache note:
  - Real-time listener over `entries` with `where('userId','in', memberIds)` and optional date bounds; ordered by `date desc`.
  - If cache provider is absent, direct query fallback not implemented.

## Terminology
- entry: a single financial transaction, can be income or expense
- recurring template: a template for a recurring transaction, can be daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly
- recurring entry: a single instance of a recurring transaction, created from a recurring template

## Analytics

- **Firebase Analytics (GA4)**
  - **Initialization**: Client-only via `getAnalytics(firebaseApp)` inside `src/lib/firebase-analytics.ts`. The GA4 `measurementId` is plumbed through `src/lib/firebase-app.ts` from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MEASUREMENT_ID`.
  - **Helper**: Use `trackEvent(eventName, params)` exported from `src/lib/firebase.ts` (re-exports `src/lib/firebase-analytics.ts`). The helper no-ops on the server and when Analytics isn't available.
  - **Tracked events**:
    - `sign_up`: when onboarding completes in `src/app/onboarding/page.tsx`.
      - Params: `method` (e.g., "google"), `user_id`, `currency`.
    - `entry_created`: after a successful entry write.
      - Manual form: `src/components/entry-form.tsx`
      - LLM input: `src/components/llm-entry-input.tsx`
      - Params: `source` ("manual"|"llm"), `type`, `amount`, `currency`, `category`, optional `confidence`, `had_file`.
    - `invite_sent`: after sending a connection invite in `src/services/connections.ts`.
      - Params: `invited_email_domain`.
  - **Docs**: See Firebase guidance for GA4 on web, `measurementId`, and the Analytics SDK [`Firebase Analytics Web setup`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/get-started?platform=web#web_2).

- **Google Ads gtag**
  - **Loading**: `src/app/layout.tsx` loads `gtag.js` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ADS_ID` and runs `gtag('config', <ADS_ID>)`.
  - **Consent Mode v2**: Defaults are set to denied in `gtag-consent-default`; `src/components/consent-manager.tsx` updates consent to granted on user approval and re-calls `gtag('config', <ADS_ID>)` as needed.
  - **Coexistence with Firebase Analytics**: We do not call `gtag('config', 'G-<GA4>')` for GA4. Firebase Analytics is initialized via the SDK (`getAnalytics`) and handles GA4 events. If you ever want to share the same GA4 stream between direct `gtag()` calls and Firebase, follow the Firebase doc section "Use Firebase with existing gtag.js tagging" (avoid duplicate GA4 `gtag('config')` and initialize Firebase Analytics before sending `gtag()` events).

- **Environments**
  - Public envs are defined in `apphosting.yaml`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEASUREMENT_ID` (GA4) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ADS_ID` (Ads). Use distinct IDs for preview/staging to avoid polluting prod data.

- **Privacy & Debugging**
  - Tracking is disabled by default until the user grants consent via the consent manager.
  - Use GA4 DebugView to verify events during local development; Firebase Analytics web typically surfaces localhost events automatically in DebugView.
